# Dynamic Brightness App

A simple Windows Forms application to adjust screen brightness on Windows using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).  
Built with C# and .NET 6.

## Features

- Adjust brightness with a slider in a Windows Forms interface
- Uses System.Management for WMI calls to change brightness
- Requires running as Administrator to modify screen brightness

## Why I made this

I created this because when switching between job applications and my Excel sheet to track them using Alt+Tab, I kept needing to adjust brightness manually. It was a hassle, broke my focus, and hurt my eyes, so this app automates that process.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code.  
3. Install the required NuGet package: **System.Management**.  
4. Build the project.  
5. Run the app as Administrator.
